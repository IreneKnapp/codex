What This Is
============

A container for discussion and early exploratory work towards a new package repository for Haskell.  Our mission is to be transparent about our design process and welcoming of community support and feedback, and to actually ship.

We are not the Hackage 2 project.  We consider that project to have failed, and, though we expect to lean heavily on the decisions that its members have made on major design issues, and perhaps even borrow some code as permitted by its license, we are dedicated to a process that everyone can participate in, and to previews becoming usable and useful from early on.

As far as specific design decisions, no individual decision is so important as to be part of our mission statement here.  But, see our issue tracker for our latest thinking on some key questions.


What This Is Not
================

There's no code yet.
